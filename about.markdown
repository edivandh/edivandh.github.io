Red Team - Malware Development in the wild - Getting into Software Exploitation and Vulnerability Research

In 2024, we focused on malware development and advanced EDR evasion techniques, experimenting with both common and lesser-known methods to bypass defensive solutions from major security vendors. We also started participating in Purple Team and Red Team operations, collaborating to test and strengthen detection and response capabilities, an area we’re still actively involved in.

This year, our focus has shifted towards software exploitation and vulnerability research, with a strong emphasis on Windows internals, kernel and user-mode exploitation. We’re diving deep into Windows memory management, IPC internals, and EDR detection mechanisms to identify weaknesses in endpoint protection solutions. Alongside exploit development, we continue expanding our Red Team toolkit with custom loaders, evasive implants, and post-exploitation techniques tailored for modern Windows environments.

We’re passionate about combining offensive security research and real-world Red Teaming to uncover practical attack paths and help organizations improve their defensive posture through actionable insights.
